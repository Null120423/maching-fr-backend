      'Bánh tráng nướng is a popular and traditional street food in Vietnam. It is typically made from fresh or dried rice paper. The rice paper is evenly coated with ingredients such as eggs, scallion oil, spices, fish cake, dried shrimp, dried squid, fried shallots, and other seasonings. Some people even add a layer of cheese on top of the rice paper to create a delicious, aromatic cheesy flavor. Once the rice paper is prepared and the seasonings are added, it is grilled over charcoal or a wood-fired stove. The bánh tráng is grilled until it becomes slightly crispy and develops an attractive golden brown color. The grilling process creates a crispy outer shell and a soft, smooth inner layer, resulting in a delightful combination of ingredients and flavors. With its fantastic taste and simple preparation, bánh tráng nướng has become an important part of Vietnamese cuisine. It is a beloved street food that can be found in various street stalls and is cherished for its unique texture and flavors.',

      'Banh Can is a type of cake developed in the South Central region of Vietnam. It is mainly made from a special type of rice flour, prepared according to a unique recipe. After soaking the rice in water, it is finely ground along with a bit of dried rice, then poured onto clay molds and grilled directly over charcoal. Afterwards, shrimp, squid, and eggs are added to make the filling. Banh Can is typically served with pickled star fruit, green mango, or cucumber. The dipping sauces for this dish include: a sauce with ground pork, diluted fish sauce with garlic and chili, scallion oil, and braised fish sauce. With these combinations, Banh Can is an experience worth trying when visiting Vietnam.',

      "The Ngoc Hoang Pagoda, also known as the Ngoc Hoang Temple (Phuoc Hai Tu), is a familiar ancient temple to the people of Saigon and tourists alike, with its captivating and unique beauty. Constructed at the beginning of the 20th century in Saigon by a Chinese individual named Luu Minh, the architecture here bears many characteristics of that nation. Unlike the venerable appearance of ancient Chinese architecture, the interiors of the temple have been partially renovated. Alongside preserving the ancient architectural features, the temple's decorations and motifs are vibrant, adding to its allure. Additionally, with its Taoist beliefs in worshipping many deities, Ngoc Hoang Pagoda is a sacred place where one can pray for fertility, love, and peace. The temple is open every day from 7 am to 6 pm.",
